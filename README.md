# The-Banking-Problem on New Year's Eve


This a small problem that I created in order to practice basic syntax commands and libraries such as Pandas in Python. You'll find the description of the problem in the uploaded pdf file. An English version will soon be available!


There is also a \*.py file which simulates the problem. You can run it in your command line for example with the following syntax:

`> bankingproblem.csv 50000`

Where *bankingproblem.csv* is the file to be read and 50000 stands for the initial stock of the bank. Have fun! :)
